## 0.1.0.1

Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` from v1.2 to v1.4.

The cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix` (although
the latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a
change log and an extra image.

## 0.1.0.0

This is the initial version of `hvega`, which is based on
version 2.2.1 of the
[Elm Vega library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1/VegaLite).
